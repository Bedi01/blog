Functions

Functions are reusable blocks of code designed to perform a particular task. They can be defined using the function keyword, expressed as variables, or even be arrow functions.

Function Declaration

function greet(name) {
    return "Hello, " + name + "!";
}
console.log(greet("Alice"));

Arrow Function

Introduced in ES6, arrow functions have a shorter syntax.

let greet = (name) => "Hello, " + name + "!";
console.log(greet("Bob"));

Basic DOM Manipulation

The Document Object Model (DOM) is an interface that represents the HTML structure of a web document. JavaScript can be used to manipulate the DOM to create dynamic content.

Selecting Elements

let element = document.getElementById("myElement");
let elements = document.getElementsByClassName("myClass");

Changing Content

let element = document.getElementById("myElement");
element.innerHTML = "New Content";

Event Handling

document.getElementById("myButton").addEventListener("click", function() {
    alert("Button Clicked!");
});

Conclusion

JavaScript is fundamental for web development, and understanding its basics is crucial for building interactive web pages. The concepts I learned, from variables and data types to DOM manipulation, lay the foundation for more advanced topics like asynchronous programming and frameworks like React or Angular.
