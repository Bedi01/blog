In Java, operators are symbols used to perform operations on variables and values. They are divided into different types:

Arithmetic Operators: Used for basic math (e.g., +, -, *, /, % for remainder).
Relational Operators: Compare values (e.g., ==, !=, >, <, >=, <=).
Logical Operators: Used for logical operations (e.g., && for AND, || for OR, ! for NOT).
Assignment Operators: Assign values to variables (e.g., =, +=, -=, *=, /=).
Unary Operators: Work on single operands (e.g., ++, -- to increment or decrement).
