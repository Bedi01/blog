In JavaScript, arrays are used to store multiple values in a single variable. Here’s a summary of key concepts you likely learned about arrays:

	1.	Array Declaration: You can declare an array using square brackets ([]) or the Array constructor. For example:

let fruits = ["apple", "banana", "orange"];
let numbers = new Array(1, 2, 3, 4);


	2.	Accessing Elements: Array elements are accessed using their index, starting at 0. For example:

console.log(fruits[0]); // Output: "apple"


	3.	Array Properties:
	•	.length: This property returns the number of elements in the array.

console.log(fruits.length); // Output: 3


	4.	Modifying Arrays: You can add or remove elements from an array using methods like:
	•	.push(): Adds an element to the end of the array.
	•	.pop(): Removes the last element of the array.
	•	.shift(): Removes the first element of the array.
	•	.unshift(): Adds an element to the beginning of the array.

fruits.push("grape");  // Adds "grape"
fruits.pop();  // Removes "grape"


	5.	Iterating Over Arrays: You can loop through arrays using loops like for, for...of, or array methods like .forEach().

fruits.forEach(function(fruit) {
  console.log(fruit);
});


	6.	Common Array Methods:
	•	.map(): Transforms each element in the array and returns a new array.
	•	.filter(): Creates a new array with elements that pass a test.
	•	.reduce(): Reduces the array to a single value based on a function.
	•	.find(): Returns the first element that satisfies a given condition.
	7.	Multidimensional Arrays: Arrays can also contain other arrays, creating nested or multidimensional arrays.

let matrix = [[1, 2], [3, 4], [5, 6]];
console.log(matrix[1][1]); // Output: 4



These are just the basics, and there’s much more to explore with arrays, especially when working with more advanced JavaScript features like destructuring, spread operators, and higher-order array methods.
