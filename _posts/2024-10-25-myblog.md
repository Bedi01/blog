In JavaScript, control flow determines the order in which code is executed, allowing the program to make decisions, repeat actions, and handle different situations. Here’s a summary of key control flow concepts:
Loops allow you to repeat code until a certain condition is met.

	•	for Loop: Iterates a set number of times.

for (let i = 0; i < 5; i++) {
  console.log(i); // Prints numbers 0 to 4
}


	•	while Loop: Executes as long as the condition is true.

let count = 0;
while (count < 5) {
  console.log(count);
  count++;
}


	•	do…while Loop: Similar to while, but executes at least once.

let count = 0;
do {
  console.log(count);
  count++;
} while (count < 5);



Break and Continue

	•	break: Exits the loop or switch statement immediately.

for (let i = 0; i < 10; i++) {
  if (i === 5) {
    break; // Stops the loop when i is 5
  }
  console.log(i);
}


	•	continue: Skips the current iteration and moves to the next one.

for (let i = 0; i < 10; i++) {
  if (i % 2 === 0) {
    continue; // Skips even numbers
  }
  console.log(i); // Prints odd numbers
}



 Ternary Operator

A shorthand for if...else statements, it’s often used for simple conditional expressions.

let age = 20;
let message = age >= 18 ? "Adult" : "Minor";
console.log(message);

These control flow structures are essential for writing dynamic, responsive, and efficient code.
