We have alot to talk about and firstly i would like to say sorry to you all i have been missing from all these days and havent given any update. Actually what happened was suddenly our college decided that student cant do online training anymore but my love for ryaz and the work culture in ryaz made me stick to it and thanks to all the amazing seniors and mentors who made it possible i was loosing hopes but they helped in every way possible. And i am back guyz so the regular work is started and i am ready to do all the stuff i get. Adios
