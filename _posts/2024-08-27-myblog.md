Java is a great language to start with if you’re new to programming. It’s widely used for everything from web apps to Android development, and its "write once, run anywhere" principle makes it super versatile. To get started, you’ll need to install the Java Development Kit (JDK) and pick an Integrated Development Environment (IDE) like IntelliJ or Eclipse to write your code.

A typical first program is the classic “Hello, World!” where you learn the basics of classes, methods, and printing output. Java is also an object-oriented language, which means you’ll be working with concepts like classes, objects, inheritance, and encapsulation.

Once you’ve got the hang of variables, loops, and basic control flow (like if-else statements), you can start diving into more advanced topics like collections, file handling, and even building web or mobile apps. There are tons of resources online, from tutorials to courses, to help you on your way.
