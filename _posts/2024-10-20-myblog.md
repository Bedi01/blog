JavaScript is a versatile, high-level programming language primarily used for creating interactive web experiences. In this blog, I’ll share what I learned about the basics of JavaScript, including variables, data types, operators, control structures, functions, and basic DOM manipulation.

1. Introduction to JavaScript

JavaScript is a scripting language used to create and control dynamic website content. Unlike HTML and CSS, which control the structure and styling of web pages, JavaScript adds interactivity.

2. Variables

Variables in JavaScript are used to store data values. They can be defined using three keywords:

	•	var: The original way to declare variables. It has a function scope.
	•	let: Introduced in ES6, it has a block scope, making it more secure.
	•	const: Used to define constants, which cannot be reassigned after initialization.

Example:

var name = "Alice";
let age = 25;
const PI = 3.14159;

3. Data Types

JavaScript supports several data types, which can be divided into primitive and non-primitive types.

	•	Primitive Types: String, Number, Boolean, Undefined, Null, Symbol, and BigInt.
	•	Non-Primitive Types: Object, Array, and Function.

Example:

let stringExample = "Hello, World!";
let numberExample = 42;
let booleanExample = true;
let undefinedExample;
let nullExample = null;

4. Operators

JavaScript uses operators to perform operations on variables and values.

	•	Arithmetic Operators: +, -, *, /, %, etc.
	•	Comparison Operators: ==, !=, ===, !==, >, <, etc.
	•	Logical Operators: &&, ||, !

Example:

let x = 10;
let y = 5;

console.log(x + y); // Output: 15
console.log(x > y); // Output: true
console.log(x === y); // Output: false

5. Control Structures

Control structures determine the flow of execution in a program.

If-Else Statements

These are used to execute a block of code based on a condition.

let score = 70;

if (score >= 60) {
    console.log("Pass");
} else {
    console.log("Fail");
}

Loops

JavaScript supports different types of loops:

	•	for loop
	•	while loop
	•	do-while loop

Example:

for (let i = 0; i < 5; i++) {
    console.log("Hello, World!");
}
