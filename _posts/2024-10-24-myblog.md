In JavaScript, control flow determines the order in which code is executed, allowing the program to make decisions, repeat actions, and handle different situations. Here’s a summary of key control flow concepts:

1. Conditional Statements

Conditional statements are used to perform different actions based on certain conditions.

	•	if Statement: Executes code if a specified condition is true.

let age = 18;
if (age >= 18) {
  console.log("You are an adult.");
}


	•	if…else Statement: Adds an alternative set of instructions if the condition is false.

if (age >= 18) {
  console.log("You are an adult.");
} else {
  console.log("You are not an adult.");
}


	•	else if Statement: Allows multiple conditions to be checked.

let score = 85;
if (score >= 90) {
  console.log("Grade: A");
} else if (score >= 80) {
  console.log("Grade: B");
} else {
  console.log("Grade: C");
}



2. Switch Statement

The switch statement provides an alternative to if...else if chains, especially when checking a single expression against multiple values.

let day = "Tuesday";
switch (day) {
  case "Monday":
    console.log("It's Monday!");
    break;
  case "Tuesday":
    console.log("It's Tuesday!");
    break;
  default:
    console.log("It's another day.");
}
